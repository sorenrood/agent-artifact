To achieve that, we followed these steps:\n\n1. Set up python-3.11 and installed the Python packages \"flask\", \"gunicorn\", and \"inotify\" using the package installation tool. These packages are now available to use, so we do not need to install them again.\n2. Created a basic Flask application in main.py that listens on port 5000.\n3. Created a \"templates\" folder and added an \"index.html\" file for the basic page structure.\n4. Set up the run configuration for our Flask application called \"Start Flask Server\" and set to the command \"gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port --reload --reload-extra-file=templates/ main:app\" so that we can run it. The workflow is currently stopped, but can be started. The Flask application is using gunicorn's reload functionality so changes to main.py or the templates will be available without needing to explicitly restart the workflow.```",
